cengine
========
a work-in-progress library for card-based games
========
cengine is not a library. it is more of a template project that happens to
contain a module. the user is expected to tweak and customize the behavior of
their cengine copy (provided they abide by the rules of the license).
========
the goal of this is write as much as possible using the go stdlib. this means
that cengine does not include any sort of UI tooling. that is simply up to the
user to write. the only thing provided is a framework to manage and control 
state.
